# The industrial space revolution. How do you stand to gain?

The title of the book by author robert zubrin advocate for space has quoted the potential for commercial space, but consider this my estimation for space is that by the end of the decade we could see the top ten percent of companies utilising space technology. Robert zubrin has often pushed many cases for space; some of which, to a pragmatic individual would be more convincing than just the financial benefit however ultimately most of us are driven by financial incentive and that's why i implore you to pay attention to the market shifts because you, financially speaking anyway might end up benefiting more than you expect.

Numerous friends have often asked me the question when giving them this exact exposition. *So have you bought any stock in spaceX?*  To which I have to glumly respond, you can’t. Interestingly enough spaceX might not be the top scorer in the space industry, the same way Jeff Bezos was able to leverage the postal industry to create amazon, the keen eyed amongst us are truly awaiting the company that will leverage starship to its maximum financial potential.

# The uncertainty of the Starship fleet.

Now understand that **the future business model of the Starship is yet to be determined by anyone including Elon Musk himself,** at this point spaceX isn't even aware of all the customers it will accommodate in the future. However based on some simple extrapolations from what the community knows how about I give you some conjecture to ponder over and you can determine whether or not there's any plausibility to my claims.

Firstly let's consider the rate that Starship is being produced. We know that the success baseline for starship is to produce two a week resulting in a launch rate of 1000 per year. Now let's also assume that we have reached the year 2025, SpaceX could have fallen short on meeting its targeted mars injection opportunities regardless the point still stands that we would expect the site at boca chica to have a massively developed manufacturing line that may also have an equally sized counter-part production facility somewhere else in the country.

What I'm getting at here is an abundance of Starships that could essentially be bought for the final manufacturing price and then overhauled to completely suit the needs of a prospective investor. Whether their goals are to have a fabrication process in space, both organ printing and ZBLAN could be potential candidates or the venture of experimental potentially ground-breaking R and D, this truly opens up Pandora's box in terms of the ideas that could come to fruition with the hardware available.

# SpaceX and it’s customers, could you be one?

When you consider that there will be specific companies that will specialise in bridging the gap between SpaceX and a company they forecast would benefit from space technology integration. Things start to fall into perspective that an industrialised low earth orbit will be another member to bend its knee to human capitalism and join the ranks of our economy, hence why I'm so confident in my opening statement.

On a closing note I believe that we are very fortunate to have the industrial space boom hit us now rather than later. It's clear that when you consider not only the current pandemic crippling the economy but also the death of the internal combustion and petrochemical industries. Those are very deep shoes to fit but if we're lucky it will outshine both with terrific performance much like the invention of the factory line changed manufacturing forever we can only wait and hope that we all equally benefit and share in the wealth that's to come.
